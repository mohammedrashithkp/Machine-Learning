# What this repo is about
This is a Repo made as a way of notetaking when I was covering the [ML for Everbody Tutorial in FCC Youtube Channel](https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg?si=MpzKq-zOeMuTnUhP).
Starting as a complete beginner , the tutorial was highly helpful in conveying the information without overwhelming the viewer.
The tutorial is Perfect for anyone who was starting out exploring ML like me .
I would advice taking some Python Tutorials and Some Math Tutorials (Linear algebra and Probability ) before staring the tutorial.
